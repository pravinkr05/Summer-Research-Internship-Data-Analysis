# Summer Research Internship 2023 On Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository documents the work conducted during the Summer Research Internship at Aliah University in Kolkata. The primary focus was on data analysis, where we delved into various datasets including Titanic, Iris, PriceItem, and GeneSequence.

## Objectives
- Cleanse datasets for quality and consistency.
- Split datasets into training and testing subsets.
- Implement SVM and Decision Tree Classifier models.
- Improve model accuracy from 80-85% to approximately 89%.
- Analyze the GeneSequence dataset which was challenging.

## Datasets
- **Titanic**: Passenger information and survival outcomes.
- **Iris**: Measurements of iris flowers.
- **PriceItem**: Pricing information for items.
- **GeneSequence**: Sequences of genes of three animals - cat, dog, and elephant.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality.
2. **Dataset Splitting**: Create training and testing sets.
3. **Model Implementation**: Use SVM and Decision Tree.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess accuracy.
5. **Model Refinement**: Improve accuracy through iterations.
6. **Challenges and Solutions**: Address dataset-specific challenges.

## Results
- Achieved approximately 89% accuracy.
- Completed analysis of all datasets, including GeneSequence.
